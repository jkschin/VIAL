# VIAL
Well, it stands for Visualize Images and Labels. I kinda got tired of naming stuff as it is so this acronym was kinda cool.

A small HTML package to visualize images and the corresponding labels for neural networks.

Done in collaboration with https://github.com/javiersuweijie. He helped me a lot in the initial commit!

# Usage

Log files must be in this format. All relevant images must be in the directory. The images are lazy loaded, so it should be okay to load many images.
