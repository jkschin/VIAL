# VIAL
Well, it stands for Visualize Images and Labels. I kinda got tired of naming stuff as it is so this acronym was kinda cool.

A small HTML package to visualize images and the corresponding labels for neural networks.

Done in collaboration with https://github.com/javiersuweijie. Well actually, he helped me a lot.

# Usage
## Log Files

Log files must be in the following format:

1.jpg 2
2.jpg 4
sample.jpg 5
test.jpg 6
etc...

## Directory
Enter the directory where all the images in the log file are stored.

Click display and you're done!

# Troubleshooting
In the event that no images are displaying, check the "Reading files from: " section, the directory might be wrong. Other than that, I can't think of any reason as to why this will fail.
